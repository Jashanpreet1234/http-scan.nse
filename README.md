# http-scan.nse
http-scan.nse is a script that is included in the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) library. It is designed to perform basic scanning and information gathering on HTTP services.

HTTP scan refers to the process of scanning web servers and applications for vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It involves sending various HTTP requests to a target server and analyzing the responses to identify potential security issues. HTTP scanning can be used by security professionals, ethical hackers, or malicious attackers to assess the security posture of a web server or application. The scan may look for common vulnerabilities such as outdated software versions, misconfigurations, weak authentication mechanisms, or known exploits.
